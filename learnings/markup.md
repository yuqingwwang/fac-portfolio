## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility
![code snippets from index.html](https://github.com/yuqingwwang/fac-portfolio/assets/44486576/113223ad-d20c-451e-874f-8c2e5d2bfd59)
 
For the [Monster Inc](https://github.com/fac28/monster-inc) Project, we made use of semantic elements in our HTML files such as \<header>, \<footer> and \<nav> to describe the function of each element. 
  
We did use the non-semantic \<div> tag with a class or id attribute quite often, which harmed the readability and accessibility of our codes. In the future, we should change them into more descriptive tags such as \<section> and \<article>. 

## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers
We tested our web page on Mac's VoiceOver to make sure all elements are readbale and descriptive.

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story
